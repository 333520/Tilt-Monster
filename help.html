<body>
	
	<p>Thank you for playing Tilt Monster! We hope you enjoy it and won't let it's sheer addictiveness consume your life... too much.</p>
	
	<h3>How to Play</h3>
	
	<p>Tilt your device to move your monster left or right as it runs through the environment. Your goal is to collect as many gems as
	you can to get the highest score before losing both hearts. Avoid enemies and other obstacles to last as long as you can each round.</p>
	
	<p>You can tap the screen at any moment to <strong>pause</strong> the game. The pause screen will also show you the items you've unlocked so far.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Gems</strong></p>
	
	<p>Collect these to increase your score. If you collect them sequentially (try your best not to miss any!), you'll get significantly more points (also known as a "gem combo", or just "gembo").</p>
	
	<p><strong>Stars</strong></p>
	
	<p>Stars (or equivalent themed items) give you points, but don't give any bonus points for collecting them sequentially (combos). Rather,
	stars are worth more depending on how long you've lasted in the round.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Items</strong></p>
	
	<p>Items are unlocked when you reach specific score thresholds (10k, 20k, 50k, 70k). When you pick them up during a game, they provide a score bonus as well as an effect that will help you last longer in the round. Items unlocked in easy mode do not show up in medium or hard mode.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Checkpoints</strong></p>
	
	<p>Last long enough and you'll cross a checkpoint. You'll earn 3,000 points every time you cross a checkpoint, and even more starting on your fifth checkpoint in a single round. Your monster will run faster every time you cross a checkpoint (making the game harder)
	so earn as many points as you can before reaching them!</p>
	
	<h3>Things to Avoid</h3>
	
	<p>Avoid all of the following enemies and obstacles (as well as equivalent themed objects):</p>
	
	<p><strong>Flying Bunnies</strong></p>
	
	<p>These enemies move towards you and will cost a heart if you they manage to touch you. These little guys will be the source of <em>most</em> of your Tilt Monster frustration.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Bombs</strong></p>
	
	<p>If you touch a bomb, whether it was intentional or on accident, you lose both of your hearts and the game is over. The only exception is if you pick up the <em>Invincibility</em> or <em>Destroy On Contact</em> items and their effects are still active. In easy mode, you lose only one heart.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Sand Pits</strong></p>
	
	<p>Running over these will cost you a heart. Note that when you pick up the <em>Destroy On Contact</em> item, this is the only obstacle that can still deal you damage.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Big Fat Cyclops</strong></p>
	
	<p>Don't let their big, cuddly looks fool you. Running into these guys will not only cost you a heart, but some hard-earned points as well.</p>
